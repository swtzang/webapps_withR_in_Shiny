#Building a reactive widget

#As we saw in the previous video, reactivity is established by linking an input with an
#output via a render*() function.

#A new sliderInput is given with some blanks to fill in. This widget will control the 
#transparency of the plotted points. It should have the ID alpha and the user facing 
#label "Alpha:". Its values should range between 0 and 1, with a default value set to 0.5.
#Make the associated update in the server function.
